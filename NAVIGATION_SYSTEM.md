# Navigation System Documentation

## Overview
The EcoBingle Connect navigation system has been refactored to provide a consistent, maintainable, and user-friendly navigation experience across the application.

## Architecture

### Centralized Configuration
All navigation routes are defined in `/client/src/shared/config/navigation.ts` to ensure consistency across all navigation components.

### Navigation Categories
Routes are organized into logical categories:

1. **Main Routes** (`category: 'main'`)
   - Core application entry points
   - Currently: Home page

2. **Eco People Routes** (`category: 'people'`)
   - Community-focused features
   - Includes: Community, Blog, News

3. **Eco Products Routes** (`category: 'products'`)
   - E-commerce and product-related features
   - Includes: All Products, My Orders

4. **User Routes** (`category: 'user'`)
   - User account and profile management
   - Includes: Dashboard, Profile, Settings
   - Requires authentication (`requiresAuth: true`)

5. **Demo Routes** (`category: 'demo'`)
   - Development and demonstration features
   - Includes: Various technical demos and features

## Navigation Components

### Primary Navigation
- **File**: `/client/src/components/Navigation.tsx`
- **Usage**: Main application navigation used in MainLayout
- **Features**: Dropdown menus, search, cart, user profile

### Shared Navbar
- **File**: `/client/src/shared/components/navigation/navbar.tsx`
- **Usage**: Reusable navbar component for other contexts
- **Features**: Theme toggle, responsive design, accessibility

### Mobile Menu
- **File**: `/client/src/shared/components/navigation/mobile-menu.tsx`
- **Features**: Focus management, accessibility, responsive design

## Routing System

### Router Configuration
- **File**: `/client/src/app/router.tsx`
- **Features**: Lazy loading, error boundaries, preloading
- **Route Categories**: Organized with comments for clarity

### Route Mapping
All routes in the router match the centralized navigation configuration:

| Route | Component | Category | Description |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `/` | CommunityPage | main | Home and community hub |
| `/products` | EcoProductsPage | products | E-commerce catalog |
| `/blog` | BlogDashboard | people | Blog and articles |
| `/news` | NewsPage | people | Environmental news |
| `/my-orders` | MyOrdersPage | products | Order tracking |
| `/dashboard` | DashboardPage | user | User dashboard |
| `/profile` | ProfilePage | user | Profile management |
| `/settings` | SettingsPage | user | Account settings |

## Key Features

### Consistency
- All navigation components use the same route definitions
- Icons and labels are standardized
- URL patterns are consistent

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management
- Screen reader compatibility

### Performance
- Lazy loading for route components
- Preloading for critical routes
- Error boundaries with retry functionality

### Maintainability
- Single source of truth for route definitions
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Centralized icon definitions
- Helper functions for route filtering

## Usage Guidelines

### Adding New Routes
1. Add route definition to `/shared/config/navigation.ts`
2. Ensure the component exists and is imported in router
3. Add route to router configuration
4. Test navigation consistency

### Modifying Navigation
1. Update centralized configuration first
2. Verify changes across all navigation components
3. Test responsive behavior
4. Validate accessibility features

### Route Categories
Choose appropriate categories for new routes:
- Use `main` for core application features
- Use `people` for community/social features
- Use `products` for e-commerce features
- Use `user` for account management
- Use `demo` for development features only

## Testing
- Test all navigation components
- Verify route consistency
- Check responsive behavior
- Validate accessibility
- Test error boundaries

## Performance Monitoring
Route performance is logged automatically:
- Load times are tracked
- Analytics events are sent
- Error rates are monitored
